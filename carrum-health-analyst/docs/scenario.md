## üß© Background

Carrum Health is a value-based healthcare platform connecting self-insured employers with surgical care providers. The platform handles sensitive patient data, including medical documents, personal health information (PHI), and personally identifiable information (PII)

## üçª Objective

As part of my early orientation into the security team here, I was asked to approach the platform with fresh eyes, simulating how an external threat actor might evaluate the patient-facing upload workflow. I have been asked to identify potential vulnerabilities and recommend mitigations without accessing production systems.
