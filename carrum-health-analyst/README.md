# Carrum Health Deep Dive

> This case study is part of my ongoing `resume-revenge-arc` series, a portfolio of simulated red team and security analyst projects based on companies Iâ€™ve applied to and been rejected by. Each case blends open-source reconnaissance, threat modeling, and simulated assessment work to demonstrate how I research, reason, and secure systems. 
>
> This case focuses on Carrum Health, a value-based healthcare platform that connects self-insured employers with high-quality surgical care providers.
